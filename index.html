      <p>SpaceBalls The Trivia.  <br>When I started out, I just wanted to make a trivia game that would keep track of your score. As I started to finish up the app, I got the idea to add in a sort of progress bar, and add "levels" so that one would have to clear level one before getting the second levels questions. I am most proud of the fact that I was able to get the progress bar to work the way I wanted it to. At first I was having difficulties getting it to stay right justified after dropping the size of it, but I was able to figure it out and I am very happy with the result.</p>
      <p>You Suck at Art. <br>This was a group project in which my role was to build the back end.  By working together with the other members of my group that were working on the front end, I was able to include all of the required requests and keep the back end up to date with the front end.  I was only able to do this because of the excellent communication and teamwork that our group was able to put out.  This project opened my eyes to what it would be like to work with a group of other Web Developers on a single project and it gave me a look into some of the issues that can arrise from not having worked in a group before.</p>
      <p>Revenge of The Bots <br>For my final project at GA, I really wanted to push the envelope.  I wanted to design something that I could be proud of and something that I could spend more than just the 1 week of class time that we are allocated to work on.  I wanted something that I could continue to work on after class and something that I was passionate about. I decided to make a game that would start out basic, as it currently is, but that would have room for me to grow it and evolve it so that as I learn more and more about coding and grow proffesionally I can continue to grow this application in my free time.</p>
